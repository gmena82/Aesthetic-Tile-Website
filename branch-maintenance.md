# Branch Maintenance Log

## Summary
- Fetched all refs with pruning to ensure local repository is up to date.
- No remote named `origin` is configured, so remote branch pruning was not performed.
- Only the current branch `work` exists locally; no merged branches were available for deletion.

## Commands Executed
```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git branch --merged origin/main  # failed: origin/main not found
git remote -v                   # confirmed no remotes configured
git branch                      # confirmed only `work` branch exists
```

## Next Steps
- Configure the `origin` remote if remote branch maintenance is required.
- Re-run the cleanup commands after additional branches are created or a remote is added.
