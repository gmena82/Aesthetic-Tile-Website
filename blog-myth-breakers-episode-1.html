                    <p>It’s finally here. All that planning and hard work the last two months paid off. We promised you something big was coming and here it is. We were allowed to film on location at The Tile Shop in Orlando, and what a great experience it was—aisles of inspiration, helpful staff, and room after room of design ideas. So here it is: the first of many segments we’ll be bringing you from The Tile Shop. We’re kicking things off with Episode 1 of Myth Breakers, our new series where we take on the biggest myths in remodeling. Today’s myth: “Tile remodels are too expensive.”</p>
                    <p>Spoiler: they don’t have to be. Read on for the full breakdown, or watch the video to see every sample and price point up close.</p>

                    <h2>Myth: “Tile remodels are too expensive”</h2>
                    <p>We hear this all the time. And we get it—if your only frame of reference is those Pinterest-perfect bathrooms with slab walls and full-room mosaics, it looks expensive. But cost isn’t just a single number; it’s the sum of choices. When you understand where each dollar goes—materials, labor, and waste—you gain control. You make strategic decisions. And suddenly “too expensive” turns into “totally doable.”</p>
                    <p>Let’s break it down the way we do with clients every day.</p>

                    <h2>Costs 101: materials, labor, and waste (and how to control each)</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Materials.</strong> Tile prices vary widely—from smart budget lines under $4/sq ft to luxury mosaics over $20/sq ft. The trick is not to avoid premium materials altogether but to use them intentionally where they’ll have the most visual impact per square foot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Labor.</strong> Installation is skilled work—especially in wet areas. The best installers don’t just set tile; they manage waterproofing, slope, layout, movement joints, and transitions. Labor is often the biggest line item, and it’s worth it. A well-installed $4 tile can look better (and last longer) than a poorly installed $15 tile.</li>
                        <li><strong>Waste.</strong> Waste isn’t “wasted money”—it’s the cuts you need to complete a clean layout. Plan ~10% waste for straight-lay floors and walls, ~15% for diagonals, herringbone, or complex patterns, and up to ~20% for tight spaces or heavy cutting. Smart planning keeps waste predictable and your budget honest.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Our floor-first budgeting philosophy</h2>
                    <p>Our host Brad summed it up perfectly in the video: <strong>Affordable floors. Moderate walls. Splurge on accents.</strong></p>
                    <p>Why? Floors typically cover the most square footage and take the most abuse. Going with a budget-friendly but durable floor tile lets you redirect dollars where they’ll show—on the walls and accent details.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>Floor pick featured in Episode 1</h3>
                        <p><strong>Savannah Fume 8&quot; × 36&quot; wood-look porcelain</strong> – $3.93/sq ft</p>
                        <p>It’s a handsome plank with the warmth of wood and the durability of porcelain. At this price point, your main flooring cost stays grounded without sacrificing style.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Pro tips for floors</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bigger planks, fewer grout lines. Cleaner look, easier upkeep.</li>
                        <li>Plan the layout before day one. Center lines, doorways, and transitions matter.</li>
                        <li>Pick a grout that disappears. A close color match makes budget tile look premium.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The wall-tile sweet spot: timeless, designer, and still affordable</h2>
                    <p>If floors are your “value anchor,” walls are where you can step up without blowing the budget. We love subway tile for this: it’s timeless, it photographs beautifully, and it plays nicely with almost any style—modern, classic, farmhouse, coastal.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>Wall tiles we handled in the aisles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Glacial Blanco</strong> – $3.99/sq ft</li>
                            <li><strong>Regent Bianco 3&quot; × 8&quot;</strong> – $5.39/sq ft</li>
                            <li><strong>Regent Ivory 3&quot; × 8&quot;</strong> (clearance) – $1.75/sq ft</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At these prices, you get a designer wall surface without the sticker shock. And because walls are typically a big visual field, that clean, consistent surface becomes the canvas for your accents to shine.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Pro tips for walls</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play with pattern, not price. Stack, offset, or herringbone (note: herringbone may raise labor and waste).</li>
                        <li>Use trim smartly. Bullnose or metal edge profiles give you a clean, finished look.</li>
                        <li>Sheen matters. Glossy reflects light in smaller baths; matte reads calm and architectural.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Where premium pays off: accents that do the heavy lifting</h2>
                    <p>Accents are the secret weapon in budget-wise design. Because they cover smaller areas, you can buy something special without inflating your total.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>Accent star of the episode</h3>
                        <p><strong>Gable with Marfil mosaic</strong> – $20.33/sq ft</p>
                        <p>Use mosaics on the shower floor (they conform to slope and add traction), niche backs, or backsplashes. A few square feet of the right mosaic looks custom and elevates the entire space.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Pro tips for accents</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limit the footprint, maximize the impact. A single niche back or a shower floor is plenty.</li>
                        <li>Tie colors together. Pull one hue from your floor and one from your walls so the accent feels intentional.</li>
                        <li>Mind transitions. Keep the plane changes tight and the edges clean—this is where craftsmanship shows.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Real-world sample budgets (materials only)</h2>
                    <p>To show how strategic choices stack up, here are three illustrative material-only scenarios for a typical small bath remodel. We assume:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Floor: ~40 sq ft (plan 10% waste → 44 sq ft)</li>
                        <li>Shower walls: ~90 sq ft (plan 10% waste → 99 sq ft)</li>
                        <li>Accents (shower floor + niche): 8–24 sq ft (plan 5% waste)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Prices shown reflect what we handled in the video. Store pricing and clearance availability can change—always verify at purchase.</p>

                    <p>What’s not included here: thinset, grout, waterproofing, backer board/uncoupling, primers, trims, and labor. Depending on your project’s scope and spec, setting materials and waterproofing commonly add a few hundred dollars to over a thousand; labor varies by market, complexity, and contractor. We’re always happy to estimate both with you once we see your space and selections.</p>

                    <h2>The “why” behind the numbers</h2>
                    <p>Look at the three scenarios again. Notice how flooring stays steady in all three? That’s not an accident—it’s your budget anchor. It’s durable, attractive, and the most square footage. By holding the floor cost, you free up dollars to upgrade the walls and add a statement accent without losing your overall spend.</p>
                    <p>Even in the Elevated Everyday plan, you’re channeling premium dollars into places that read as custom: clean walls and an artful mosaic. That’s what people notice first.</p>

                    <h2>Professional-grade results (without surprise costs)</h2>
                    <p>Here’s how we keep projects looking “magazine” without the magazine price tag:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start with measurements and a mood board.</strong> Bring rough dimensions, photos of your space, and 3–5 inspiration pics. We’ll translate the vibe into real materials that fit your budget.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose a layout that suits your budget.</strong> Straight-lay and simple offsets keep waste and labor predictable. Save patterns like herringbone for feature walls or small areas if you love them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right-size the premium zone.</strong> Niche backs, a shower floor, a backsplash under open shelving—these are high-impact, low-square-footage areas perfect for mosaics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Waterproof like it matters.</strong> In showers, we spec membranes and details (proper slope, seams, corners, and penetrations) that protect your investment. This is where a pro crew earns their keep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don’t skip transitions and trims.</strong> Schluter-style profiles or bullnose create a crisp, finished edge that elevates the whole room. Small line item, big visual payoff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Color-match your grout.</strong> This one makes budget tile look custom. Pick grout that blends; only contrast grout if it’s a deliberate style move.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The tiles we handled—why they work</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Savannah Fume 8&quot; × 36&quot;</strong> | $3.93/sq ft — Warm, real-wood character with porcelain durability. Longer planks visually expand small baths and look great in straight or 1/3-offset patterns. At under $4/sq ft, you get longevity and style.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glacial Blanco</strong> | $3.99/sq ft — Clean brightness. In a shower or vanity wall, this lifts the whole room. Use stacked for a modern feel or traditional offset for classic charm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regent Bianco 3&quot; × 8&quot;</strong> | $5.39/sq ft — A step up. Slightly richer surface and a size that feels boutique. Perfect when you want a touch more refinement without going premium-premium.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regent Ivory 3&quot; × 8&quot;</strong> | $1.75/sq ft (clearance) — Clearance is your secret budget weapon. If the tone fits your palette, this is where you win big on walls. Stock varies—check your store.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gable with Marfil mosaic</strong> | $20.33/sq ft — High-impact accent. Gorgeous for shower floors (great for slope and grip) and niche backs. Because you only need a handful of square feet, you get the “wow” without wrecking the budget.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="note-text">Pricing note: All figures above were referenced in our in-store filming. Retail pricing changes and clearance items come and go—confirm current store pricing at time of purchase.</p>

                    <h2>Common upgrade questions we get (and honest answers)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>“Can I do a fancy pattern everywhere?”</strong> You can, but your waste and labor will jump. Our approach: pick one focal surface (like a vanity wall or niche) for patterns, keep the rest clean.</li>
                        <li><strong>“Is bigger tile always better?”</strong> Bigger tile means fewer grout lines and a modern look, but it also demands flatter substrates and careful handling. Sometimes a 12&quot; × 24&quot; is the sweet spot in smaller rooms.</li>
                        <li><strong>“What about grout—epoxy or cement?”</strong> Epoxy is stain-resistant and great for wet areas, but it’s pricier and trickier to install. High-quality cement grout with a sealer is still excellent for many projects. We’ll advise based on your space and use.</li>
                        <li><strong>“Can we go curbless?”</strong> Curbless showers look incredible and are easier to enter, but they require precise prep (recessed subfloor, proper slope, linear drain considerations). Budget more for this detail.</li>
                        <li><strong>“Do I have to move plumbing to get the look I want?”</strong> Usually not. Keeping plumbing in place is one of the best ways to control costs. We’ll design with your existing layout when it makes sense.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The walkthrough from our shoot (highlights)</h2>
                    <p>Brad led us through a practical, budget-smart path:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start with the floor—we looked at Savannah Fume 8&quot; × 36&quot; at $3.93/sq ft as a durable, beautiful baseline.</li>
                        <li>Pick a wall tile in the $3.99–$5.39 range for a designer-clean finish (and we even spotted a $1.75 clearance option!).</li>
                        <li>Add a premium accent where it counts—like the Gable with Marfil mosaic at $20.33/sq ft—for the shower floor or niche back.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>That combination—value floor, mid-priced walls, premium accent—is the blueprint for rooms that look high-end without a high-end bill.</p>

                    <h2>Ready to budget your project?</h2>
                    <p>Here’s a simple checklist you can bring to your consultation (or email to us):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Room type &amp; size: e.g., 5' × 8' bath, 3-wall alcove shower</li>
                        <li>Inspiration pics (3–5): colors, styles, patterns you love</li>
                        <li>Floor pick: value porcelain plank (target ~$3.50–$4.25/sq ft)</li>
                        <li>Wall pick: clean subway/rectified tile (target ~$3.75–$5.50/sq ft)</li>
                        <li>Accent pick: mosaic for shower floor/niche (target ~$15–$25/sq ft)</li>
                        <li>Must-haves: niche count/size, bench, shelves, trim style</li>
                        <li>Nice-to-haves: specialty patterns on one wall, curbless, linear drain</li>
                        <li>Budget guardrails: your total materials target and any must-stay-under number</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Final word: myth broken</h2>
                    <p>Are some remodels expensive? Of course. But tile itself isn’t the villain. It’s how the pieces are chosen and where the dollars go.

                    <p>That’s the Myth Breakers method: <strong>Affordable floors. Moderate walls. Premium accents.</strong> It’s simple. It’s smart. And it works.</p>
